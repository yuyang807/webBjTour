					When And How To Apply For A Tourist Visa
				</div>
				<div class="tour_faqs_linklist_text">
					If you stay in China for more than 72 hours, you should get a tourist visa to visit China, we are happy to offer you the invitation letter if you were requested a invitation letter by Chinese embassy, pls email us to let us know everyone’s full name, birth date, passport number and expire dates, arrival and departure date and cities you will stay  in China.<br>
					The single-entry tourist visa normally has a validity period of three months so it’s better to apply for a China tourist visa 30 to 60 days before your intended date of entry. If you apply too far in advance, the visa may expire.<br>
					Unless you are traveling as a traveling party, you will need to arrange your own visa. You normally need one photograph, a completed application form for each person, and a bank check or credit card. Fedex or another courier can handle the transfer and return. Search on the internet for the Chinese embassy or consulate nearest to you. You can also apply for Chinese visas outside of your home country, just make sure that you fulfill the application requirements.<br>
					Some countries have visa agents but this adds substantially to the cost. If you can go straight to the embassy/consulate it will be cheaper.<br>
					Visa applications are normally processed within three to four working days but you can choose to pay an extra amount to rush it. If you go to the visa office you may be able to get a visa on the same day for  special fee.<br>
					When applying for China tourist visas, the procedures, requirements, issue time, and fee may vary from country to country. Details and application forms can be found on the website of the Chinese embassy in your country.<br>
					Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months at the time of arrival in China.<br>
